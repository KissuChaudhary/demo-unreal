            <strong>Train the Model:</strong> This is where the magic happens! Follow these steps to get your personalized AI model ready for headshot generation:
            <div className="my-4">
              <Image src="/content/guide2.webp" alt="UnrealShot AI model training interface" width={800} height={400} className="rounded-lg shadow-md" />
            </div>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-8 mt-2">
              <li><strong>Name Your Model</strong>: Start by giving your model a unique and recognizable name. For example, you might call it something like "John's Professional Headshots" so you can easily find it later.</li>
              <li><strong>Select the Gender</strong>: Choose the type of headshot you'd like based on gender. You have three options:
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-12">
                  <li>Man</li>
                  <li>Woman</li>
                  <li>Unisex</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Upload Your Photos</strong>: Next, upload 4–10 of your best images. Keep these guidelines in mind to get the best possible headshots from the AI:
                <div className="my-4">
                  <Image src="/content/guide3.webp" alt="UnrealShot photo upload interface" width={800} height={400} className="rounded-lg shadow-md" />
                </div>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-12">
                  <li>Solo Images Only: No group shots; the AI needs to focus solely on you.</li>
                  <li>Clear and Sharp Photos: Avoid blurry or low-resolution pictures—high-quality images lead to better results.</li>
                  <li>No Hats or Caps: Make sure your face is fully visible, without any headwear.</li>
                  <li>Neutral Expressions: Opt for neutral, professional looks rather than playful or exaggerated expressions.</li>
                  <li>No Selfies in Cars or Mirrors: Try to use well-lit, professional-looking images.</li>
                  <li><strong>Recent Photos</strong>: Use current images that accurately represent how you look today.</li>
                  <li><strong>Variety in Your Uploads</strong>: Ensure a mix of different outfits, backgrounds, and facial expressions. This helps the AI build a more versatile and well-rounded model of your appearance.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Start the Training Process: Once you've uploaded your images, click the "Train Model" button. This step will use one credit from your account.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li className="mb-4">
            <strong>Wait for Processing:</strong> The AI will process the images, which typically takes between 30 to 60 minutes. During this time, the AI carefully analyzes your photos to create a customized headshot model. Once the training is complete, you will see a status update saying, "Model Training Finished."
